  They had five strings.
>>>>> They were advertised as the "new 'Les Paul' model".
 They had wooden pick-ups.
 They were only available in a shocking pink finish.

Around 1959 the "Les Paul" model was discontinued and Gibson launched their SG model one or two years later as the second version "Les Paul" with a "Les Paul Model" decal on the headstock. By 1962 Les Paul's endorsement contract was up for re-negotiation and he objected to the new model bearing his name. Eventually he sued Gibson to have them remove his name from the SG, which then became known under that very name.

Gibson later relaunched the 'Les Paul' in the late 1960s.
