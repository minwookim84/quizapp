var explanations = [
	"Leo Fender produced the 'Broadcaster', which was a prototype of the 'Telecaster', in 1951.",
	"Around 1959 the \"Les Paul\" model was discontinued and Gibson launched their SG model one or two years later as the second version \"Les Paul\" with a \"Les Paul Model\" decal on the headstock. By 1962 Les Paul's endorsement contract was up for re-negotiation and he objected to the new model bearing his name. Eventually he sued Gibson to have them remove his name from the SG, which then became known under that very name. Gibson later relaunched the 'Les Paul' in the late 1960s.",
	"Cans are also known as headphones, potentiometers are dials, and the bridge lifts the strings over the fretboard.",
	"Les Paul endorsed an electric guitar for the Gibson Guitar Company, that is still in use today, known as the Gibson Les Paul. The other three choices are guitar players. Although, all three have had guitars named for them as well.",
	"The 'Black Beauty' is a 1957 'Les Paul Custom' which has three humbucking pick-ups and is finished in black. A truly beautiful guitar.",
	"The 'Stratocaster', or 'Strat' as it is affectionately known, is probably the best selling guitar of all time."
